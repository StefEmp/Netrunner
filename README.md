# Netrunner

Netrunner is a basic game coded in C++. You are a hacker, you need to figure out the correct codes to progress. 
There are 5 levels to complete. 
The game is played in your terminal.

To run the game, simply download the repo and from the project location (in terminal), type cl netrunner.cpp. Following this, type netrunner.

This game was made using pure C++ (no Unreal Engine this time!)

I learnt about creating this game by following a C++ and Unreal Engine course on Udemy. If your interested in having a go at the course yourself, check it out here: https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/

Big thanks to the guys at GameDev.TV Team for having such an informative course!
